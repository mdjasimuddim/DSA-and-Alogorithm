// 1.Understanding the problem 
//     i).restate the problem in own words
//     ii).what are the input and outputs
//     iii).is there enough information to solve the problem 
//     iv).Thinking of labelling data (don't use random label like i,j,k,a,b)
//     v).checking the example with invalid, empty input

// 2. Note own the details like Input, output,outcome
// 3. Start with the naive/brute force approach.First thinks that come to mind that you're able to think well
//and critically

//Write a function that takes two numbers and return the result
//Addition of two numbers
//input 10 14 output -> 24
//input 12 34 output -> 46

function sum(num1, num2){
    return num1+num2;
}
console.log(sum(10,14));
console.log('md jasim uddim');

// 4. Tell them why this approach is not best (O^2 or higher or not readable etc...)
// 5. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things.
// 6. Before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to follow
// 7. Breakdown the steps and commenting is the ultimate key, Rundown of thinking process, steps, Breaking
// 8. start coding(simplify as necessary)
// 9. can you write it better in therms of readability, time, space complexity ?
// 10. If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interviewer usually ends here. 
// It is also Common that that the interviewer asks you extension questions.
